Probably a lot sooner than you are comfortable with. Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there [10]. Just because you have still got a list of things to do does not mean it is not done. Do not hold everything else up because of a few leftovers. You can do them later. And doing them later may mean doing them better, too. [10]. There are many enhancements and extensions which will be added in the future, first, the method of detect skin disease must be on the mobile application developed, then detection the skin lesion in Dermis layer of the skin, finally must detect all the skin disease in the world and degree of disease. 7. Conclusion Detection of skin diseases is a very important step to reduce death rates, disease transmission and the development of the skin disease. Clinical procedures to detect skin diseases are very expensive and time-consuming. Image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. In this research the method of detection was designed by using pretrained convolutional neural network (AlexNet) and SVM. In conclusion, we must not forget that this research has an effective role in the detection of skin diseases in Saudi Arabia because it has a very hot weather for the presence of deserts; this indicates that skin diseases are widespread. This research supports medical efficiency in Saudi Arabia. Table 1. Disease Detection Rate",
